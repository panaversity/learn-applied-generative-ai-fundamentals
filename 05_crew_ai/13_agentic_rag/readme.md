# Agentic RAG

Implementing an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in CrewAI involves integrating AI agents with retrieval mechanisms to enhance information generation.

## Understanding RAG vs. Agentic RAG:

**Traditional RAG**: Combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce responses based on both stored knowledge and external data. It operates passively, retrieving information upon request without dynamic decision-making.

**Agentic RAG**: Enhances traditional RAG by incorporating intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision-making. These agents actively determine when and how to retrieve information, select appropriate tools, and adapt to changing contexts, resulting in more contextually aware and intelligent interactions.
