# Creating a Custom GPT

Detailed guide on creating a custom GPT with OpenAI:

**Prerequisites:**

* An OpenAI account with a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs are not available on free plans).

**Steps:**

1. **Access the GPT Builder:** Navigate to the GPT builder through two options:
   - Visit [https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt) directly.
   - If you're already logged in to ChatGPT, click on your username and then select "My GPTs". There, you'll find the option to "Create a GPT".

2. **Interact with the GPT Builder:** The GPT Builder uses a conversational interface. Briefly describe the purpose of your custom GPT. 

3. **Provide Core Details (Create Tab):** 
   - **Name and Description:** Craft a clear and descriptive name for your GPT and a brief explanation of its function.

4. **Configure Your GPT (Configure Tab):** This tab allows for further customization. Here's what you can adjust:
   - **Profile Picture:** Upload your own image or use OpenAI's DALLE-2 to generate one that reflects your GPT's purpose. 
   - **Additional Instructions:** Here's where you refine your GPT's behavior and capabilities. Provide detailed instructions and guidelines on:
      - How your GPT should respond and interact.
      - Specific tasks it should be able to perform.
      - Unwanted behaviors to avoid. 

5. **Fine-tune with Conversation Starters:** Conversation starters are prompts that guide your GPT's responses in specific situations. You can add prompts or remove existing ones based on your needs.


6. **Perfect Instruction Writer:**

**Sharing and Publishing (Optional):**

- By default, your custom GPT is private and only accessible to you. 
- In the top right corner, you can choose sharing options:
   - **Anyone with the Link:** Anyone with a ChatGPT subscription who has the link can access your GPT.
   - **Public:** Publish your GPT to the GPT Store (coming soon), making it available to everyone.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Leverage Examples:** Explore existing GPTs in the GPT Store (once available) for inspiration and to see how others have structured their custom models. 
- **Start Simple:** Begin with a focused purpose for your GPT and gradually add complexity as you refine it.
- **Iterate and Improve:**  The more you interact with your GPT and provide feedback, the better it will learn and adapt to your requirements.

By following these steps and using the GPT Builder's features, you can create a custom OpenAI GPT tailored to your specific needs and interests.
